      Currently, I am a rising sophomore at Rutgers University in New Jersey. 
      My major is computer science and I plan to minor in Korean or math.
      Even though I live close to Rutgers, I dorm on campus and it has been amazing 
      so far. This upcoming semester, I hope to make more unforgettable memories.

        High school ultimate frisbee teams are rare, but I was lucky enough to 
        attend a school with a team. I played JV my first year, and varsity
        the remaining three years. I have also played for a club team named DEVYL
        where I played with a regional team to compete for national championship.
        I currently play for the Rutgers club team, and I am hoping we can make 
        it to college nationals!

      You might have come across the "ice cream guy" or "subway guy" 
      on TikTok and YouTube. I followed their steps and recorded
      my experiences working at Taco Bell. I first posted on TikTok, not 
      expecting a lot of feedback, but I woke up the next day and saw 
      my video had reached thousands of views. This made me excited
      and I continued to create content on TikTok, eventually
      extending my content to YouTube as well.

      On top of all of this, I love to travel. The past summer
      I went to Hawaii with my family visiting Oahu and the Big Island.
      Left and right, there was plenty of amazing food, people, culture, 
      and nature. I also enjoy day trips to New York City, observing
      the modernity around me and exploring new places. This summer I 
      will be studying abroad at Ewha University, a college in 
      Seoul, South Korea. I am extremely excited and plan to share
      my experiences.
