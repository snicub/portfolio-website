      I am a rising sophomore at Rutgers University in New Jersey. 
      My major is computer science and I plan to minor in Korean or math.
      I guess cs is cool and I guess it helped me make this website.
      Even though I live close to Rutgers, I dorm on campus and it has been amazing 
      so far. This upcoming semester, I hope to make more unforgettable memories 
      and will make sure to buy a lot of pedialyte. I really hope I get AC tho.

        High school ultimate frisbee teams are rare, but I was lucky enough to 
        attend a school with a team. I played JV my first year and varsity
        the remaining three years. I have also played for a club team named DEVYL
        where I played with a regional team to compete for a national championship title.
        I currently play for the Rutgers club team, and am hoping we can make 
        it to college nationals! I guess throwing frisbees at cookouts and family functions
        was good practice after all.

      You might have come across the "ice cream guy" or "subway guy" 
      on TikTok and YouTube. I followed their steps and recorded
      my experiences working at Taco Bell. I first posted on TikTok, not 
      expecting a lot of engagement, but I woke up the next day and saw 
      that my video had reached thousands of views. This motivated me
      cause I chase clout and I continued to create content on TikTok, eventually
      extending my content to YouTube as well. Chicken Chalupas with 
      spicy ranch sauce are like dat.

        Traveled dummy far miles to Hawaii with my family last summer visiting 
      Oahu and the Big Island. Left and right, there was plenty of amazing food, 
      people, culture, and nature. I really like ahi poke and ube ice cream ong. 
      I also enjoy day trips to NYC, observing the modernity around me and exploring 
      new exciting places like the Lincoln Tunnel.

      I went to Watchung Hills Regional High School in Warren, NJ. 
      I graduated in June 2021. I played frisbee. I read books.
      I ate a lot of calzones and double fried french fries. I got a parking passs my junior
      year which was pretty cool I guess. Ms. Nunez if you're reading
      this you're goated ong. Oh and I got written up once 
      for being late to zoom class.

      I got into fishing my senior year of high school. It's pretty fun and 
      relaxing. I'm into freshwater fishing and even though I suck at catching bass,
      catching small sunfish is still fun. I like going by myself and spending hours
      on the pond side. I've caught one bass with a ned rig. I guess they don't
      want my topwaters or crankbaits.
