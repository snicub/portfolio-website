      My major is computer science. ig you know that by now. I'm also double majoring in Korean.
      Even though I live close to campus, I still dorm and it has been really fun 
      so far. I also believe C's get degrees.

        High school ultimate frisbee teams are rare, but I was lucky enough to 
        attend a school with a team. I played JV my first year and varsity
        the remaining three years. I have also played for a club team named DEVYL
        where I played with a regional team to compete for a national championship title.
        I currently play for the Rutgers club team, and am hoping we can make 
        it to college nationals! I guess throwing frisbees at cookouts and family functions
        was good practice after all.

      You might have come across the "ice cream guy" or "subway guy" 
      on TikTok and YouTube. I followed their steps and recorded
      my experiences working at Taco Bell. I first posted on TikTok, not 
      expecting a lot of engagement, but I woke up the next day and saw 
      that my video had reached thousands of views. This motivated me
      cause I chase clout and I continued to create content on TikTok, eventually
      extending my content to YouTube as well. Chicken chalupas with 
      spicy ranch sauce are like dat. You can find my YouTube & TikTok below!

      Some might just call me a flaneur. My most memorable trips have been to Hawaii, South Korea, and Montreal.
      I traveled with family in Hawaii, studied abroad at Ewha womans univeristy in SK, and had a friends trip to Montreal. 
      No matter how far or close I went, there was plenty of amazing food, 
      people, culture, nature, and memories. I really like ahi poke and ube ice cream and lamb skewers. ty JJ. 
      I also enjoy day trips to NYC, observing the modernity around me and exploring 
      new exciting places like the Lincoln Tunnel.

      I am currently an intern at Colgate-Palmolive where I work on embedded systems.
      It's been a really fun and an interesting time learning how my degree is used in industry.
      My first project was printing sensor data connected to an MCU via I2C. I had no idea how
      to code embedded, so this project taught me a lot. My next project will be full stack!

      I got into fishing my senior year of high school. It's pretty fun and 
      relaxing. I'm into freshwater fishing and even though I suck at catching bass,
      catching small sunfish is still fun. I like going by myself and spending hours
      on the pond side. I've caught one bass with a ned rig. I guess they don't
      want my topwaters or crankbaits.
