      Currently, I am a rising sophomore at Rutgers University in New Jersey. 
      My major is computer science and I plan to minor in Korean or math.
      I guess cs is cool and I guess it helped me make this website.
      Even though I live close to Rutgers, I dorm on campus and it has been amazing 
      so far. This upcoming semester, I hope to make more unforgettable memories 
      and will make sure to buy a lot of pedialytes. Also I really hope I have AC tho.

        High school ultimate frisbee teams are rare, but I was lucky enough to 
        attend a school with a team. I played JV my first year and varsity
        the remaining three years. I have also played for a club team named DEVYL
        where I played with a regional team to compete for a national championship title.
        I currently play for the Rutgers club team, and am hoping we can make 
        it to college nationals! I guess throwing frisbees at cookouts and family functions
        was good practice after all.

      You might have come across the "ice cream guy" or "subway guy" 
      on TikTok and YouTube. I followed their steps and recorded
      my experiences working at Taco Bell. I first posted on TikTok, not 
      expecting a lot of engagement, but I woke up the next day and saw 
      that my video had reached thousands of views. This motivated me
      cause I chase clout and I continued to create content on TikTok, eventually
      extending my content to YouTube as well. Chicken Chalupas with 
      spicy ranch sauce are like dat.

      Traveled dummy far miles to Hawaii with my family last summer visiting 
      Oahu and the Big Island. Left and right, there was plenty of amazing food, 
      people, culture, and nature. I really like ahi poke and ube ice cream ong. 
      I also enjoy day trips to New York City, observing the modernity around me and exploring 
      new exciting places like the Lincoln Tunnel. This summer I 
      will be studying abroad at Ewha University, a college in 
      Seoul, South Korea. I am extremely excited to study in a different country and plan to share
      my experiences on myspace.
